# game_of_go
Implementation of game of go (also known as baduk, weiqi) in C++ using SFML.
Currently there is a very basic GUI and random AI implemented.


Requirements: 1) C++11, 2) SFML 2.3.2

The program was tested on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS Xenial, gcc 5.4.0.

Instructions:

1) For an out-of-place build: create a build directory (mkdir build)
2) Change directory to the created build directory (cd build)
3) Create build files with CMake in the build directory (cmake ..)
4) Build the project (e.g. for Unix makefiles it is achieved by using "make" command in the terminal)
5) Launch the executable file "game_of_go".

The project is early in the development stage, so there are a lot of things yet to be implemented.
