# game_of_go
Implementation of game of go (baduk, weiqi) in C++ using SFML

Requirements: 1) C++11, 2) SFML 2.4.2

The program was tested on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS Xenial, gcc 5.4.0.

Instructions:

1) Update the makefile with the correct location of SFML_DIR (that is, the directory where SFML is located on your computer).
2) Build the project, using "make" command in the terminal.
3) Launch the executable file "game_of_go".

The project is early in the development stage, so there are a lot of things yet to be implemented.
